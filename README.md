## Reticulated

<img src="docs/reticulated_logo.webp">

Reticulated is a Reticulum Network simulator that spawns live, interactive [Reticulum](https://github.com/markqvist/reticulum) instances controllable from a node-based Web UI. 

You can create networks of any topology and set bitrate, MTU, and configure path loss and propagation behavior. It provides a top-down view to a live network. You can connect any Reticulum application to the simulated network. It also has built in utilities like a basic LXMF chat function and Resource transfer included.

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `lxmf`
- `rnsd`, `rnstatus`, `rnpath` on `PATH` (installed with the `rns` package)

## Install and run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000.

```bash
python run.py --port 9000                 # web UI on 9000
python run.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000  # listen on all interfaces
python run.py --hub-port 5900             # move the medium hub off 5800
SIM_PORT=9000 SIM_HUB_PORT=5900 python run.py
```

## Live RNS topology

The UI has two independent modes. **Simulation** retains the original editable
simulator. **Live RNS** is a read-only view of the local shared Reticulum
instance. It polls `rnstatus -j` and `rnpath -t -j` every five seconds and
exposes the normalized result at `GET /api/live/state`.

Run Reticulated as the same user that can access the shared RNS instance, then
select **Live RNS** in the toolbar. The local hostname is used for the root
label; it can be given a friendlier name such as Patroon without hard-coding a
transport identity:

```bash
LIVE_RNS_LABEL=Patroon python run.py
```

Optional live-mode settings are:

- `LIVE_RNS_RNSTATUS` and `LIVE_RNS_RNPATH`: executable paths
- `LIVE_RNS_CONFIG_DIR`: alternate local Reticulum config directory
- `LIVE_RNS_TIMEOUT`: per-command timeout in seconds (default `3`)
- `LIVE_RNS_INTERVAL`: backend collection interval in seconds (default `5`)

Live paths show only what the local transport reports. Solid edges represent
the local instance, its interfaces, and reported next-hop transports. Dashed
edges lead to known destinations and label any unresolved remaining hops; the
application never fabricates intermediate routers. If either command fails,
the API reports the error and retains the last good data from that source.

Each node's `instance_name` is derived from the data directory under simdata/
